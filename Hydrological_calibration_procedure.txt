Hydrological calibration procedure:

1.    Identifying poor performing month

2.    Generating a sequence of simulated rainfall from the SRM with a pre-defined set of parameters.

3.	Generating a sequence of simulated runoff using the rainfall runoff model with the simulated rainfall as input.

4.	Computing pairs of statistics from the simulated runoff and the observed runoff as well as the simulated rainfall and the observed rainfall.
	
5.	Computing an objective function with the simulated and observed rainfall and runoff statistics.

OF = a*SARE1(probs>0.5) + b*SARE2(prob<0.5) + c*SSE_rain
if SARE1 > SARE2 => a=0.8, b=0.1, c=0.1
else                a=0.1, b=0.8, c=0.1

6.	Finding the SRM parameters set that optimizes the objective function.
