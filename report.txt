gamma distribution behavior
lower gamma : skew to low value; higher gamma tend to high value; gamma = 5 on ward start to have bell shape like normal distribution

hihger beta (scale parameter) >>> Lower value sample
higher alpha (shape parameter) >>> skew to right >>> more higher values in distribution

increase both beta and alpha will slow down the skew to right process

-run GR4J with flow stats

Alpha Case: +1; +10, alpha increases >>> skew to the right >>> more toward high flow values
Beta Case: +1; +10, beta increases
