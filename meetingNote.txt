- introduction: gap, 

section 2: motivated example, conceptual example, why bad, conceptual flow duration curve
case study: implementatio of the process, WGEN Fr4j

results: story of results

records length, what the clibration do in fixing rainfall attribtue

AGENDA: timeline - intro skeleton - coding

I havent figure out what are the results that I am planning to deliver in the paper yet. so in the next week I will work on a plan for results to be discussed. but at this point to do you have any sugestion that I should look into in terms of planning what I should include in the result?

goal: obtain calibrated parameters

what is the stoping point of the optimisation?

would you agree on running optimization with 1 realisation of rainfall?

different site different catchment behaviour reason why it is bad in the results. summary out of 20 sites into category 

runoff coeeficient . aridity index for site
run mulyiple sitye. what make ist bad the streamfglow

story of literature: SRM exist - known that rainfall can have error on streamflow - surprise that ram aint evaluated agin streamflow. started with 2 - non linear efeect - list of type of erroer - focus onm rainfal runofff tranformation

workit out ikn word
